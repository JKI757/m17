So I've been looking into M17 texting. My understanding is:
Texting currently is only over RF because there's no M17Gateway or reflector support.
There's no OpenRTX support, so the only way to text with M17 is with @adf7021's Nokia device or a radio+modem and some of the tools in https://github.com/M17-Project/M17_Implementations
Is that correct?

You can use Digirig too
Or a GameBoy Advance... but let's say it's not an option for many ðŸ™‚
So - correct

If we skip the routing issue that you mentioned the other day, gateway/reflector support would still be useful, right? You could send and receive messages with anyone connected to the same reflector, rather than just the same repeater/hotspot.
Once you have a network protocol defined, someone could build bridges to other messaging systems like APRS.

adf7021 â€” Today at 11:45 AM
Sure it would be useful
Yep
@n7tae where's the M17 reflector protocol described now?

Jim N1ADJ â€” Today at 11:49 AM
Here, I think: https://github.com/n7tae/mrefd/blob/master/M17-ref-packet-description.ods

adf7021 â€” Today at 11:53 AM
@n7tae we need to have a doc like this under M17 github
Can't open ods at the moment, but I think I know what's in it

It's not as detailed as the original version in the M17 specification a while back.

Jim N1ADJ â€” Today at 11:56 AM
Google Docs will open it.

adf7021 â€” Today at 12:00 PM
I'll talk with Tom

A quick look at M17Gateway makes me think that it forwards any M17 data it sees, so if it were connected to a reflector that could handle Packet Mode data it would deliver it. But mrefd wouldn't know what to do with it.

G4KLX â€” Today at 12:02 PM
Which is why the MMDVM doesn't support packet mode (yet), where would I send it?

Jim N1ADJ â€” Today at 12:04 PM
To @adf7021's Nokia ðŸ˜€ ? Definitely a chicken and egg problem.

adf7021 â€” Today at 12:06 PM
For now, the Nokia can only tx arbitrary packets

adf7021 â€” Today at 12:07 PM
Can't wait to add reception too and share some 84x48 wallpapers and screensavers


So kc1awv's go-m17-relay required a one line buffer size change and it now relays Packet Mode. And my little text client can send and receive messages. M17Gateway and MMDVMHost don't know about PacketMode, so I'd need a way to go audio to go-m17-relay and vice versa. Then I could send messages to and from these tools: https://github.com/M17-Project/M17_Implementations/tree/main/SP5WWP/m17-packet


A couple spec-related questions:
